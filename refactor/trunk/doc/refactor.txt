PRESENTATION                                *refactor-presentation*       {{{1


This plugin defines some refactoring oriented mappings and commands that applies
to several different languages.
The behavior of the facilities defined can be tweaked for any type of file. 

This plugin should be seen as a framework aimed at refactoring in Vim.
As it is designed to support any language, it may not be as adapted as a plugin
specifically designed for a particular language could be. 


==============================================================================
EXTRACT-METHOD REFACTORING                  *refactor-extract-method*     {{{1


This refactoring consists in extracting lines of code, lines that will be used
as a start for a new function (/method).

------------------------------------------------------------
Typical steps to extract a function~
1- Select the lines (in |visual-mode|) you wish to use as a start for a new
   function
2- Type in the command-line: |:ExtractFunction|, or trigger the mapping
  |v_CTRL-X_f|. The lines disappear and are replaced by a function call.
  |Markers| (/|placeholders|) may be automatically inserted in the function
   call.
3- Do not forget to execute |:PutExtractedFunction| (or |CTRL-X_p|) to insert
   the body of the new function back into the code

Note: only one extracted function will be remembered at a time.


------------------------------------------------------------
Commands for extracting functions~

*:ExtractFunction* [{Name} [({arguments})]
This command cuts the lines visually selected, and replaces them by a function
call. The lines extracted are stored for |:PutExtractedFunction| until the next
use of |:ExtractFunction|.

The function name can be specified as the optional argument {name}. By default, a
|marker| will be used if no name is given.

After the name, we can also specify {arguments} (surrounded by brackets). At
this point, no processing over the list of arguments is done. Specifying them
can be useful in non typed languages, but useless and unpractical with typed
languages. The default value for {arguments} will also be a |marker|.

*:PutExtractedFunction* [!]
This command inserts, back into the current buffer, the code previously
extracted. The code is put back as a function. The signature of the function is
automatically adapted to fit the language in which the code is written.

The new function will be put after the current line in which the cursor is. 
If the commanded is "banged" (!), the function will be inserted before the
current line.


------------------------------------------------------------
(EM) Languages support~

A few languages are already supported by the refactoring Extract-Method
implemented in refactor.vim: C, C++, Java, Pascal, sh, VimL

                                                        *refactor-EM_new-ft*
In order to define hooks for this refactoring, the function
|lh#refactor#fill()| shall ne used with the following arguments:
  - "EM" (as in "Extract Method")
  - {ft}
  - {hook} which tells which hook we want to define
    This refactoring expect at least the two hooks to be defined:
    - "_call" that describes how the function call is built
    - "_function" that describes how the extracted function definition is
      built.
    Both takes the parameter "_fname" in case a function name is given to
    |:ExtractFunction|, and "_function" also takes the parameter "_body".

  Simple example: sh >
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'sh', '_call', ['fcall'])
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'sh', 'fcall', lh#function#bind('v:1_._fname ." ".Marker_Txt("paramters")') )
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'sh', '_function', ['begin', '_body', 'end'])
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'sh', 'begin', [ 'fsig', 'open' ] )
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'sh', 'fsig', lh#function#bind('v:1_._fname . "()"'))
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'sh', 'open', " {\n" )
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'sh', 'end',  ['placeholder', 'close', 'placeholder'] )
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'sh', 'placeholder', lh#function#bind('Marker_Txt()'))
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'sh', 'close',  "\n}" )


- If we want to reuse an hook defined for another filetype, we can
  set the function |lh#refactor#inherit()|.
  For instance, The default definitions for C++ and Java point to C hook.
  Note: any one level of indirections is supported. i.e.: >
    call lh#refactor#inherit('EM', 'c', 'cpp', 0)
    call lh#refactor#inherit('EM', 'cpp', 'csharp', 0)
< work as expected.


Complex examples~
- procedure/function in Pascal, with injection of user dialog results: >
    " 1- _call entry point is componed of thwo parts
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', '_call',      ['ask_kind', 'call'])
    " 1.1- first ask the user whether it is a procedure or a function thanks to
    "      lh#refactor#let
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'ask_kind', lh#refactor#let('kind_',
      \  "WHICH('CONFIRM', 'nature of the routine? ', 'function\nprocedure', 1)"))
    " 1.2- then defines what replaces the code "deleted" ; as the replacement
    "      is some active code, lh#function#bind is used
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'call',      
    \ lh#function#bind("(v:1_.kind_ == 'function' ? Marker_Txt('variable').' := ' : '') . lh#refactor#hfunc(v:1_._fname).';'.Marker_Txt()", '_fname'))


    " 2- _function entry point is made of several parts, among which _body is
    "     already defined (as it is one of the parameters available)
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', '_function',  ['begin', '_body', 'return', 'end'])

    " 2.1- "begin" expands into the kind_ (filled by "ask_kind") + the
    "      function signature, a placeholder for variables and the keyword "begin"
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'begin',      ['kind_', 'SPACE', 'fsig', 'NL', 'vars', 'NL', 'k_begin', 'NL'])
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'vars',       lh#function#bind('Marker_Txt("var").";"'))
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'fsig',       lh#function#bind('lh#refactor#hfunc(v:1_._fname)'))
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'SPACE',      " ")
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'NL',         "\n")
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'return',     lh#function#bind("v:1_.kind_ == 'function' ? (v:1_._fname) . ' := '.Marker_Txt('value').';\n' : ''"))
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'end',        ['k_end', 'placeholder', 'NL'])
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'k_begin',    "begin")
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'k_end',      "end")
    call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'pascal', 'placeholder', lh#function#bind('Marker_Txt()'))

As we can see, this specialization asks the user whether he wants to extract a
function or a procedure. The variable is stored (in "ask_kind") for later use
in the hooks "call", "return", and "begin")

- check class name/scope in C++



==============================================================================
EXTRACT-TYPE REFACTORING                    *refactor-extract-type*       {{{1


This refactoring consists in extracting a complex type expression in the code,
and define a new type. 

------------------------------------------------------------
Typical steps to extract a type~
1- Select the text (in |visual-mode|) you wish to use as a start for a new
   type
2- Type in the command-line: "|:ExtractType| newTypeName". The selection
   disappears and is replaced by the new type name.
3- Do not forget to execute |:PutExtractedType| to insert the declaration of
   the new type back into the code

Note: only one extracted type will be remembered at a time.


------------------------------------------------------------
Commands for extracting types~

*:ExtractType* {Name}
This command cuts the visual selection, and replaces it by a typename.
The type expression extracted is stored for |:PutExtractedType| until the next
use of |:ExtractType|.

The type name must be specified as the argument {name}.


*:PutExtractedType* [!]
This command inserts, back into the current buffer, the code previously
extracted. The code is put back as a type declaration. The declaration of the
type is automatically adapted to fit the language in which the code is
written.

The declaration will be put after the current line in which the cursor is. If
the commanded is "banged" (!), the declaration will be inserted before the
current line.


------------------------------------------------------------
(ET) Languages support~

The behavior of these commands can be tuned for various languages. See
|refactor-extend|.

In order to define hooks for this refactoring, the function
|lh#refactor#fill()| shall ne used with the following arguments:
  - "ET" (as in "Extract Type")
  - {ft}
  - {hook} which tells which hook we want to define
    This refactoring expect at least the two hooks to be defined:
    - "_use" that describes what replaces the extracted type
    - "_definition" that describes how the extracted type definition is built.
    Both takes the parameter "_typename" in case a type name is given to
    |:ExtractType|, and "_definition" also takes the parameter
    "_typeexpression".


==============================================================================
EXTRACT-VARIABLE REFACTORING               *refactor-extract-variable*    {{{1


This refactoring consists in extracting a complex variable expression in the code,
and define a new variable. 

------------------------------------------------------------
Typical steps to extract a variable~
1- Select the text (in |visual-mode|) you wish to use as a start for a new
   variable
2- Variable in the command-line: "|:ExtractVariable| newVariableName". The selection
   disappears and is replaced by the new variable name.
3- Do not forget to execute |:PutExtractedVariable| to insert the declaration of
   the new variable back into the code

Note: only one extracted variable will be remembered at a time.


------------------------------------------------------------
Commands for extracting variables~

*:ExtractVariable* {Name}
This command cuts the visual selection, and replaces it by a variable name.
The expression extracted is stored for |:PutExtractedVariable| until the next
use of |:ExtractVariable|.

The variable name must be specified as the argument {name}.

The user is asked whether he wants to replace all other occurrences of the
expression in the file by the variable name.

*:PutExtractedVariable* [!]
This command inserts, back into the current buffer, the code previously
extracted. The code is put back as a variable declaration. The declaration of
the variable is automatically adapted to fit the language in which the code is
written.

The declaration will be put after the current line in which the cursor is. If
the commanded is "banged" (!), the declaration will be inserted before the
current line.


------------------------------------------------------------
(EV) Languages support~

The behavior of these commands can be tuned for various languages. See
|refactor-extend|.

In order to define hooks for this refactoring, the function
|lh#refactor#fill()| shall ne used with the following arguments:
  - "EV" (as in "Extract Variable")
  - {ft}
  - {hook} which tells which hook we want to define
    This refactoring expect at least the two hooks to be defined:
    - "_use" that describes what replaces the extracted type
    - "_definition" that describes how the extracted type definition is built.
    Both takes the parameter "_varname" in case a type name is given to
    |:ExtractType|, and "_definition" also takes the parameter
    "_value".


==============================================================================
EXTRACT-GETTER REFACTORING                  *refactor-extract-getter*     {{{1
EXTRACT-SETTER REFACTORING                  *refactor-extract-setter*

Thess refactorings are executed on the line where a class attribute is
defined.  The attribute is decoded, and the definition of its getter (/resp.
setter) is built and cached.

------------------------------------------------------------
Typical steps to extract a getter/setter~
1- Put the cursor on the line of definition of a class attribute.
2- Trigger the extraction with |n_CTRL-X_g| (/resp. |n_CTRL-X_s|
3- Do not forget to execute |n_CTRL-X_p|| to insert the definition of
   the new getter (/resp setter).

Note: only one extracted getter (/resp setter) will be remembered at a time.
These refactorings are of course restricted to OO Languages.

------------------------------------------------------------
(EG/ES) Languages support~

A few languages are already supported by the refactoring Extract-Getter/Setter
implemented in refactor.vim: C++, Java, and C#.

Remarks:
- Issues of const-correctness are taken into account in C++.
- I'm not a Java nor C# guy. Hence attribute decoding may require some tuning
  for those languages. LEt me know if you find any bug.

The behavior of these commands can be tuned for various languages. See
|refactor-extend|.

In order to define hooks for this refactoring, the function
|lh#refactor#fill()| shall ne used with the following arguments:
  - "Eg" (as in "Extract Getter"), or "Es" (as in "Extract Setter")
  - {ft}
  - {hook} which tells which hook we want to define
    This refactoring expect at least the following hook to be defined:
    "_definition" that describes how the extracted accessor/mutator
      definition is built.
    It takes the following parameters: (this will change!)
    - "_name"
    - "_type"
    - "_static"
    - "_fname"
    - "_args"
    - "_instruction"

ENCAPSULATE-FIELD REFACTORING               *refactor-encapsulate-field*  {{{1

Yet to be implemented -- thanks to extract-setter and extract-getter
This refactoring is of course restricted to OO Languages.

EXTRACT-CLASS REFACTORING                   *refactor-extract-class*      {{{1

Yet to be implemented
This refactoring is of course restricted to OO Languages.

(propose a way to tag the functions to completely extract, to have in both
classes (in this case, a class may delegate its work to the other (relations
between the classes (inheritance, composition, reference, .....))), or just keep
it where it is)

EXTENDING REFACTOR                          *refactor-extend*             {{{1

Supporting new refactorings require the intervene on lh-refactor code.
However, supporting new languages with the already existing refactorings is
quite simple, as long as we are used to VimL.

A specialization for a new language must be added into a |plugin|, into one's
|.vimrc|, or into the global zone of a |ftplugin|.

Each refactoring:
- expects to define a few hook (for each supported langage) ,
- provides data for the hooks to exploit.

The list of hooks and variables exported is specified along with the
documentation of each refactoring.  By convention, "standard" hooks and
variables begin with an underscore.

The task of specializing a refactoring for a new filetype can then be
summarize as defining the expected hooks for each hooks that need to be
defined.


                                                *lh#refactor#fill()*
Defining a new hook is done with |lh#refactor#fill()|which takes the following
arguments:
- the refactoring kind,
- the filetype it applies to,
- the hook name,
- and how the hook expands.

That last parameter is the one that requires the most attention. It can be:
- either of |List| of other hook (names), or variables (names),  e.g. >
  call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'vim', '_function', ['begin', '_body_', 'end'])
- or a replacement text, e.g. >
  call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'c', 'close', "\n}")
- or a |lhvl#function|, e.g. >
  call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'vim', 'placeholder', lh#refactor#placeholder(''))
  call lh#refactor#fill('EM', 'vim', 'fsig',
       \ lh#function#bind('lh#refactor#hfunc(v:1_._fname)'))
<

                                                *refactor-hook-override*
Hooks can be overridden. In that case the last definition is the one kept.
This has two applications:
- you can override any setting to your tastes in a plugin (not necessarily in
  after/plugin/). e.g. you don't want spaces around the assign operator when
  extracting variables in C ? >
  call lh#refactor#fill('EV', 'c', 'assign', '=')
- you can share most settings within anoher filetype, but not one specific
  hook ; that's what has been done for the "type" hook of the Extract Variable
  refactoring between C and C++: >
  call lh#refactor#inherit('EV', 'c', 'cpp', 1)
  call lh#refactor#fill('EV', 'c', 'type',   lh#refactor#placeholder('type', ' '))
  " C++1x
  call lh#refactor#fill('EV', 'cpp', 'type', lh#refactor#placeholder('auto', ' '))
< see |lh#refactor#inherit()|.


                                                *lh#refactor#inherit()*
The hooks of a refactoring that have defined for one filetype that be reused
for another filetype thanks to |lh#refactor#inherit()|. The functions takes a
following parameters:
- the refactoring kind,
- the filetype inherited
- the filetype inheriting
- whether the hooks are shared (0), of copied (1, see |deepcopy()|)
If a hook is shared, overiding it will override the hook for all the filetypes
sharing it.

Helper functors~
                                                *lh#refactor#hfunc()*
It returns its argument followed by "(«parameters»)" if its argument contains
no open-bracket "(".

                                                *lh#refactor#placeholder()*
Returns a |lhvl#function| that returns a dynamically computed
placeholder/|marker| thanks to |Marker_Txt()|. As it is dynamically computed,
the placeholder characters may be changed at anytime.

                                                *lh#refactor#let()#*
Returns a |lhvl#function| that assigns a value into a variable that is made
available to all hooks of the refactoring.

NOTES                                       *refactor-notes*              {{{1

Requirements~
|lh-vim-lib| (for |lhvl#function|)
|bracketing.base.vim| (for |Marker_Txt()|),
|lh-dev| (for various options)

Design notes~
function => dynamic. i.e. the Marker-characters can be changed before
:ExtractFunction. We can even define hooks that will ask for things (like
function names, visibility, ...) to the end-user (with |inputdialog()| for
instance).


Future developments~
lh-refactor may change the way the things inserted are built in a later
version.  Indeed, |mu-template| already offer many feature that lh-refactor
may take advantage of.

Regarding |refactor-extract-method|, I intend to play with |tags| in order to
extract the variables that need to be exchanged between the current scope and
the extracted function.

And of course, many other refactorings need to be implemented.
